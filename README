TODO
- Camera goes to 0,0 on reset(). Should probably go to player.
- Helper collisions break and are generally wonky.
- inconsistent jump height

This program requires that you have vorbis-tools installed.
Since we play .ogg music, the build defers to ogg123.
As long as you can use ogg123 from the command line, the music
should be able to play correctly.

There may be sound issues depending on your installation.

Move with arrow keys. Jump with either spacebar or up.. Pause and 
access menu with P. Press spacebar at the high score screen to continue
with a new game. Jump on top of the enemies to get rid of them. You
can't jump on top of the enemies with spiky protective helmets.
You start with 5 lives. Your current lives is displayed on the
bottom right corner. Your score is in the top right corner.
Get to the door at the end of the level to win.

List of things that need fixing:
 - collisions from below don't work, they move the player to the side
 - when the camera is moving, the player graphic is jittery
 - level 3 is janky
 - camera upon level reset moves around in wonky ways
 - music doesn't work

Fixes:
 - This works most of the time, we adjusted the logic to check for collisions and made
   each clause more specific.
 - A smoother scrolling method was implemented to move the camera alongside
   the player instead of constantly centering on it, but it still doesn't
   look good.
 - Level objects in the text file were adjusted and I think it's better.
 - This was fixed by specifying that the camera reset to (0,0) upon a level reset.
 - A workaround identical to a previous iteration was implemented, but it's not
   what we ultimately want.

List of visible improvements from last time:
 - new title graphic
 - smoother camera?
 - collisions from below sometimes work
 - background colors
 - enemy eye and mouth colors brighter
 - music glitch workaround
 - level 3 layout adjustment
 - jibby blinks less frequently

Here is what each member accomplished:
Devin: Created and inserted new title graphic.
Chris: Implemented the musical glitch workaround, though not perfect. Updated
	the layout for level 3.
Kevin: Adjusted camera movement.
William: Made Jibby blink slower. Updated color palettes on enemies.

(We implemented a cheat. By pressing R, you can force a level advance.
Obviously, since level 3 doesn't exist, pressing R on level 2 will crash
the game. We would take this out, but figured the graders may appreciate
not having to go through level 1 over and over to get to 2.)

That's all for now.
