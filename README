This program requires that you have vorbis-tools installed.
Since we play .ogg music, the build defers to ogg123.
As long as you can use ogg123 from the command line, the music
should be able to play correctly.

There may be sound issues depending on your installation.
When running through valgrind or a VM, the game can get choppy
and dt can reach high enough values to break collisions.

Press Escape to instantly quit.

*****PROGRESS*******
- parallax backgrounds implemented
- camera jank on level 3 fixed
- snek is visually changed
- door on lv 3 isnt invisible anymore
- text box proportions changed
- 2nd font to distinguish dialogue added
- helpers can't jump with another player on top - this fixes some jank
  with the rider on top falling through
********************

Here is what each member accomplished:
Devin: Restructured code to work pretty much exclusively with pointers.
	Fixed a bunch of memory leaks - not sure if I can do any more.
	Changed ground collisions again to be a bit nicer with valgrind
		and hopefully alleviate some issues with helpers.
Chris: Changed text box dimensions and added 2nd font.
Kevin: Scrolling backgrounds that move slower than the camera does.
William: Made all the new graphics.

(We implemented a cheat. By pressing R, you can force a level advance.
Obviously, since level 5 doesn't exist, pressing R on level 4 will crash
the game. We would take this out, but figured the graders may appreciate
not having to go through each level over and over. Also K resets the 
level in exchange for a life. This was used for testing but you may need
it in case something unexpected happens)

J to toggle superjumps and G for god mode.

********TODO********
- game crashes when dying on 0 lives, but sometimes doesn't
- but sometimes the game advances a level instead of a game over
- sometimes helpers on lv 4 dont spawn correctly (addressed but not sure if totally fixed)
- give indication of completing game instead of jumping to high scores
- track down memory leaks
- inconsistent jumps
- more content
********************

That's all for now.
