This program requires that you have vorbis-tools installed.
Since we play .ogg music, the build defers to ogg123.
As long as you can use ogg123 from the command line, the music
should be able to play correctly.

There may be sound issues depending on your installation.

Move with arrow keys. Jump with either spacebar or up.. Pause and 
access menu with P. Press spacebar at the high score screen to continue
with a new game. Jump on top of the enemies to get rid of them. You
can't jump on top of the enemies with spiky protective helmets.
You start with 5 lives. Your current lives is displayed on the
bottom right corner. Your score is in the top right corner.
Get to the door at the end of the level to win.

List of improvements from last time:
 - Collisions with ground objects work now. You can fall on top of
   the ground and stay there. You get blocked when moving into a wall.
 - You no longer jitter up and down on top of the ground.
 - A lives system is implemented. You start with 5 and lose them by dying.
   You game over by dying at 0 lives.
 - You can die by falling into a pit now.
 - Enemies and enemy movement has been implemented. They move left
   and right. They disappear if you jump on top of them.
 - A new enemy type has been implemented. They wear spiky helmets to
   protect their noggins from you.
 - The level is longer and more interesting.
 - Graphical improvements include new ground textures and a spiffy
   purple background. I think it looks pretty.

Devin: Implemented enemy collision behavior. Corrected collision
	detection with ground objects. Implemented pitfalls.

That's all for now.
