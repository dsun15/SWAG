This program requires that you have vorbis-tools installed.
Since we play .ogg music, the build defers to ogg123.
As long as you can use ogg123 from the command line, the music
should be able to play correctly.

There may be sound issues depending on your installation.

Move with arrow keys. Jump with either spacebar or up. Pause and 
access menu with P. Press spacebar at the high score screen to continue
with a new game. Jump on top of the enemies to get rid of them. You
can't jump on top of the enemies with spiky protective helmets.
You start with 5 lives. Your current lives is displayed on the
bottom right corner. Your score is in the top right corner.
Get to the door at the end of the level to win.

Use the helpers in each level to get to the end. Press Q or E to cycle
through the available players. Press W to automatically return to Jibby.
You can use the helpers as platforms and chauffers, but you shouldn't
try to jump with someone on your shoulders, since that's dangerous.

List of visible improvements from last time:
 - helpers implemented
 - new level
 - layout adjustments for existing levels

Here is what each member accomplished:
Devin: Helper implementation, collision adjustments. Bug fixes.
Chris: Baseline for text boxes for instructions and story. This doesn't work yet
       so it's not visible. Bug fixes.
Kevin: QWE controls, bug fix for a teleport
William: Graphics and level design.

(We implemented a cheat. By pressing R, you can force a level advance.
Obviously, since level 5 doesn't exist, pressing R on level 2 will crash
the game. We would take this out, but figured the graders may appreciate
not having to go through each level over and over.)

That's all for now.
