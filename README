This program requires that you have vorbis-tools installed.
Since we play .ogg music, the build defers to ogg123.
As long as you can use ogg123 from the command line, the music
should be able to play correctly.

There may be sound issues depending on your installation.

*****PROGRESS*******
- text implemented, gets offset correctly
- P on pause screen unpauses
- tutorial level
- helpers dying no longer decrease life count
- changed font
- text written to appropriate places
- camera fixed
- arrow indicating which player you are implemented
- glitches related to above fixed
********************

Here is what each member accomplished:
Devin: Text implemented, added dialogues, current player indicator, bug fixes
Chris: Added instructional texts, bug fixes
Kevin: Camera fix, bug fixes
William: Graphics and level 0 (tutorial).

(We implemented a cheat. By pressing R, you can force a level advance.
Obviously, since level 5 doesn't exist, pressing R on level 5 will crash
the game. We would take this out, but figured the graders may appreciate
not having to go through each level over and over. Also K resets the 
level in exchange for a life. This was used for testing but you may need
it in case something unexpected happens)

********TODO********
- spawning and respawning in level 3 doesn't work correctly
- track down memory leaks
- inconsistent jumps
- differentiate  ialogue with instruction text via font/color
- level 4 is really jank
  * first helper has issues respawning (idk why, workaround)
  * long green  helper has issues crossing gap (left collide is triggered)
- needs more content
********************

That's all for now.
