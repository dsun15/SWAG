This program requires that you have vorbis-tools installed.
Since we play .ogg music, the build defers to ogg123.
As long as you can use ogg123 from the command line, the music
should be able to play correctly.

This built and ran fine on Linux, but there were sound issues for Mac.

Move with arrow keys. Jump with spacebar. Pause and access menu with P.
Press spacebar at the high score screen to continue with a new game.
Get to the door at the end of the level to win.

This code is a buggy mess.
Collision detection with platforms doesn't work. You get magnetized
to the top of a platform and you can't jump until you leave the block.
For sanity's sake, and to make it possible to win, I disabled dying
to pitfalls, and I didn't put in horizontal collision for platforms.
If I did, the game would be unplayable.
